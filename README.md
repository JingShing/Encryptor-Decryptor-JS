Using Javascript and Html to rewrite my old Encryptor-Decryptor.

This is rewrite from my old repo [Encryptor-Decryptor](https://github.com/JingShing/Encryptor-Decryptor).

You can put the content you want to encrypt or decrypt in the content textfield. And put key in key textfield.

Then click button it will encrypt or decrypt for you.
